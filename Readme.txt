This code was created to test how run rotating images having different
size and to test explosions effects to add them in my first Space Defender
but, in the long run, adding new images and code, the program tooks a new
form; so j decided to create a new game: Space Defender 2 (not a great 
fantasy about a new title, eh?).

At the beginning j had thought to create several missions with a final 
boss at the end of each of them, like as in my first game, but the program
became very huge to upload it.
So j decided to code an endless cicle with 6 waves of badguys and leave 
you the enjoyment to create your own missions: try to add new spacecrafts, 
new flying paths, new powerup weapons and so on.

Space Defender 2 is written in Microsoft Visual Basic 5.0 and it run
utilizing some Windows API; you must have DirectX 5 or higher because
of music and sounds effects.
You must copy Alphablending.dll in your system directory otherwise an error
occurs when you go in pause.

Graphics are my own variations of MKS's Demonstar 3.21 shareware version
artworks, realized using Paint Shop Pro 5 and Adobe Photoshop 5.0;
background is taken from Zooom.
The astromines look like second world war floating mines but when
exploding the result is very cool j think, especially after getting
powerup gun, isn't it?.

The Ship restarting function is not ready yet, sorry.

The program changes the screen resolution, then restores it at the end of 
the game with 32 bit colors: if your pc does not support it, change it in 
the ScreenRes Module.

The game has been tested on my Pentium MMX 166 Mhz with Windows 95 and on my brother's 
Pentium III 400 Mhz with Windows 98.
On Windows NT sometimes the CreateCompatibleDC gives problems on creating the Device
Context because of you can not specify the LR_LOADFROMFILE flag. 

If your PC is more powerfull than mine probably you have to decrease the
velocity of spaceships and bullets to play.

J wish to thank RANCOR,DARKSKIES, XIM and NOVA MAN for their congraturations on my
first Space Defender: they were a stimulus to continue on it.

VB is not the most flexible games development environment, but is possible to
create very cool things, as you can see.
If you have seen my first Space Defender, you can notice that this code
is not too much different from that; so, with few modifications and with a bit of
fantasy the results look like two different works. 
J hope someone can learn from this program.
Everybody can modify the code or employ parts of it within your own projects;
only one restriction: nobody must use any part of this program in commercial purposes.

Send the game to friends, and have fun with it.
Feel encouraged to spread the program around the net.  

If you didn't have played my first Space Defender, find and download it from this site.

Happy coding and have fun!
